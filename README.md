# T1ny_bl0om (README IN PROGRESS)

This project was born as a my own exercise of soldering but it's grown in a more complex tiny project.
## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

To achive this project you need basicaly 3 things:
* A soldering station
* A 3D printer capable of 0.1mm high, I had a FFF type but probably is better a SLA/SLS
* A Pc with arduino IDE on it and a ISP for flashing
On top of those  you need a lot of patiente but at the end of the story you will have a tiny little device that you can program fro your pc and is big as a 2â‚¬ coins.

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
