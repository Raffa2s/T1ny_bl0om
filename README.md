# T1ny_bl0om (README IN PROGRESS)

This project was born as a my own exercise of soldering but it's grown in a more complex tiny project.

This project was inspired by this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kN0PZbytzZM) from Adafruit and you can use this for your props, cosplay, or photoshooting give you the possibility to choose one (ore more) specific color and his own intensity and duration (in case you want a fade effect between different color).

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

To achive this project you need basicaly 3 things:
* A soldering station
* A 3D printer capable of 0.1mm high, I had a FFF type but probably is better a SLA/SLS
* A Pc with arduino IDE on it and a ISP for flashing
On top of those  you need a lot of patiente but at the end of the story you will have a tiny little device that you can program fro your pc and is big as a 2â‚¬ coins.

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.
