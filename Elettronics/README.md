# T1ny_bl0om - Elettronics

## Getting Started

### Requisites

It's important to have the right hardware for the job, so this is mine:
- Soldering iron, mine is a Weller WHS 40
- Soldering station, mine is [this one](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32817153181.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4d8S5X5Y) Set E, that had a soldering iron and solder past
- Solder past, [mine](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32623418957.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4d8S5X5Y) but the one that came with the soldering station works fine
- Flux paste, [mine](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32331668231.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4dDTmYnn) and works fine
- Soldering fume extractor, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNbNKMQhCOQ) is very articuleted but it's important to have a kind of a extractor to evacuate the soldering fume

The following instractions is divide in two part:
- ISP
- T1ny_bl0om

If you have a flasher you can skip the ISP part and go straight to the T1ny_bl0om part.

### ISP

#### Build of Materials

- An arduino nano [link](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32341832857.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4diAN1ap)
- A 10 Î¼F capacitor, here you have a set of those [link](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32866006892.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.59a8181buVlWT5&algo_pvid=d772c5c8-fa64-40fe-81dd-571abab0b6f3&algo_expid=d772c5c8-fa64-40fe-81dd-571abab0b6f3-1&btsid=62429975-cd1c-4d59-b215-f225cd1a05c2&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0%2Csearchweb201602_8%2Csearchweb201603_52)
- A 5mm led or similar [link](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Light-Emitting-Diodes-LED_f5Short-legs-Round-with-edge-Super-bright-red-hair-red-Bagged-RHOS_C52721.html)
- A pcb, if you want you can upload directly the file *ISP/Flasher.zip* to [jlcpcb](https://jlcpcb.com/quote) or where do you want, I design the pcb with [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/) so if you wanto to modify it you can import the __*.json__ file inside EasyEDA
- A program clam [link](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1902568501.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4dFCbfAZ)
- Some pin [link](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32933682566.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.5861aafb0Lzcu7&algo_pvid=395d35a2-14b8-4aa8-b148-d58824a5238f&algo_expid=395d35a2-14b8-4aa8-b148-d58824a5238f-9&btsid=77c1d013-cb10-408f-9189-24a4d940a41c&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0%2Csearchweb201602_8%2Csearchweb201603_52)

#### Steps
It's basically soldiring at this point:
1. Solder the pin,led and capacitor to the board
2. Solder the pin to arduino nano
3. **Upload to the arduino the ISP sketch**
4. Solder arduino to the pcb

Complete :tada::tada::tada:

Now it's time for the tiny.
