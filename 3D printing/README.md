- A 3D printer capable of 0.1mm high, I had a FFF type but probably is better a SLA/SLS
- A Clear filament (in my case it was a petg from Creozone [Link](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32830591502.html?ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0%2Csearchweb201602_8_10065_10068_319_317_10696_10084_453_10083_454_10618_10304_10307_10820_10821_537_10302_536_10843_10059_10884_10887_321_322_10103%2Csearchweb201603_52%2CppcSwitch_0&algo_expid=12bb8986-55f0-40f5-9eec-46a4e6282a33-1&algo_pvid=12bb8986-55f0-40f5-9eec-46a4e6282a33)
- An opaque or black filament (in my case it was a petg from Prusa [Link](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/prusament/802-prusament-petg-jet-black-1kg.html)

For the settings, everything is good if allow you to achive a good finished print with the minimum efford; by the way is important to have setted:
- Layer high: 0.1mm
- Infill: 100%

Over that is really important to have:
- A good compensation for the SKEW (if you have a problem or don't know how to do, please see this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfAb5IaHDSo))
- A good flow settings (if you don't know how to do, try this test from [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:342198))

### Step
It's pretty strait forward:
- Download
- Slice with the setting above (remember to rotate the Top.stl)
- Print
- Test fit
